                <h3>Here's a time-line of MS Dhoni's Career:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>July 7, 1981</strong> - Born in Ranchi, Bihar [now Jharkhand] state, India</li>
                    <li><strong>December 2004</strong> - December 2004: Dhoni makes his international debut against Bangladesh in an ODI at Chittagong.</li>
                    <li><strong>October 2005</strong> - Promoted up the order to accelerate scoring, Dhoni smashes an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, the then record of the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings. Dhoni also wins Man of the Series award after India's 3-0 triumph in the five-match rubber.</li>
                    <li><strong>December 2005</strong> - Dhoni makes his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Chennai.</li>
