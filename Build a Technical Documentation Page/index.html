                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine that you're building a house. One of the first things you would do to build a house is put up a frame. There would be nothing but plain, wooden beams in the rough shape of a house, and you wouldn't be able to live in it yet, but it would give an approximation of what the house would eventually look like. The frame would provide the foundation you need to keep working.
                </p>
                <img src="images\house-frame.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    You can think of <strong>HTML</strong> as that frame for a webpage. HTML is a computer language known as a <strong>markup language</strong>, and the vast majority of the webpages you see on the Internet every day are made of HTML, among other things. 
                </p>

                <h2>What are HTML elements?</h2>
                <p>
                    Like the frame of a house might be composed of individual pieces of wood, an <strong>HTML document</strong> is composed of individual <strong>HTML elements</strong>. Here is an example of a simple HTML element:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;This is an element&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    Each HTML element is made up of <strong>tags</strong>, which for this element are the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; symbols you see on either side. You can think of them as a <strong>container</strong>, where the &lt;p&gt; tag marks the beginning of an element, the &lt;/p&gt; tag marks the end, and the content is the text in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tags in the image below specify that the text inside is a <strong>paragraph</strong>, which lets your browser know how to display it. If you were to load that <p> element in a webpage, for example, you would not see the <p> and </p> tags on the screen. Your browser would just read those tags as <strong>instructions</strong> to take the text in between and show it on the screen, and to give that text a little space above and below, and to let it take up a whole line on its own, just like a paragraph printed in a book.
                </p>
                <img src="images\hml2.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    In other words, HTML elements provide the <strong>structure</strong> of your page, just like the frame provides the structure of a house. HTML elements generally look very plain on their own—we'll get to that later, when <strong>CSS</strong> provides the <strong>presentation</strong> of your page—but they are the skeleton under all of the webpages you visit.
                </p>
                <h2>Nested Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    If you think of an HTML element as a <strong>container</strong>, it's important to note that text is not the only thing that can go inside of it. Sometimes you will want to put one HTML element inside of another, which is referred to as <strong>nesting</strong> the element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you wanted to make one of the words in a paragraph italic, the HTML element <i> can do that, but to pick out just one word in your paragraph, you would need to <strong>put it inside the paragraph element</strong>. It might look like this, for example:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;Here is a paragraph with &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; word in italics.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    In this case, the <strong>paragraph element</strong> contains both text and an <strong>italic element</strong>>. It would display in your browser like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images\italics.PNG" alt="">
                <h2>How does that make a webpage?</h2>
                <p>
                    A webpage is a <strong>collection of HTML elements</strong> in an HTML document. The HTML for a very simple webpage might look something like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;h1&gt;My Coding Blog&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;February 13, 2020&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;I heard all the best web companies start out in garages. My garage is full of trash, though, so what am I supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
                <p>
                    Most of the webpages you regularly visit are going to have more elements than this, and there are some that your browser will require by default. <strong>Don't worry about that for now</strong>, though. The important thing to keep in mind is that an HTML document is a file, just like any other file you might find on you computer. For example, you could save the the code above to your hard drive and call it <strong>website.html</strong>:
                </p>
                <img src="images\htmlfile.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Then you could double-click it to open it with a <strong>web browser</strong>, just the way one might open a Word Document in Microsoft Word. When your browser opens the file, it uses the HTML you've written as <strong>instructions</strong> to determine what it should show on the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The webpages you visit every day on the Internet are no different. When you <strong>enter a web address</strong> into your search bar or <strong>on a link</strong>, you're sending a request to a computer somewhere else, and that computer sends you a response in the form of an HTML document. In turn, your browser reads that HTML document, just like it would if you double-clicked an HTML file on your hard drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, try <a href="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/global/coding/simplehtml.html">clicking here</a> to open the example as an <strong>actual webpage</strong>. You should see something like this in a new tab or window:
                </p>
                <img src="images\blogsample.PNG" alt="">
                <p>Now follow these quick steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Right-click</strong> anywhere on the page you just opened.</li>
                    <li>
                        Find and click the option that says <strong>View page source</strong>. Depending on what browser you're using, it's possible that the option may not be there. We recommend using <strong>Google</strong> Chrome to ensure that you have the best experience with these exercises.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images\viewpagesource.jpg" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another tab or window should open, showing you the <strong>HTML</strong> of the page.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images\rawhtml.jpg" alt="">
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Look familiar?</p>
                <p>
                    Most of the webpages you visit certainly look more complicated than what you see here, but the <strong>underlying frame</strong> is still the same. No matter how elaborate they may be, the core is still HTML.

                    Once you have a basic grasp on what HTML actually is, you need to be able to see it work. A great way to do that is to <strong>write and run your own HTML</strong> on your computer. This lesson assumes that you've set up your workspace and are comfortable with the general skills that all of these tutorials require, so be sure to read lessons if not.
                </p>
                <h2>Create the file</h2>
                <p>Follow these steps to create your first HTML file.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open <strong>Sublime Text</strong>.</li>
                    <li>
                        Open the <strong>File</strong> menu and select <strong>New File</strong>.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/newfile.jpg" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>You should see a <strong>new tab</strong> open in Sublime Text labeled <strong>untitled</strong>.</li>
                    <li>
                        Go back to the <strong>File</strong> menu and choose <strong>Save As</strong>.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/saveas.jpg" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find the <strong>GCF Programming Tutorials</strong> folder you created when you set up your workspace and <strong>double-click</strong> on it.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/saveas2.jpg" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Name your file <strong>index.html</strong> and press the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You have now created an <strong>empty HTML file</strong> where you'll write your first code in the following steps. There isn't anything fundamentally different about the file you just created and a text file, for example, which you could have named index.txt. The difference is that the <strong>file extension</strong> (.html, as opposed to .txt) will let any program trying to open the file know what kinds of contents it will find inside.
                </p>
                <img src="filename.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    The name you gave it, <strong>index.html</strong>, is a common name for the <strong>home page</strong> of a website. You could name it mywebsite.html, or xxlovin2codexx.html, or whatever you want, and it will work the same. The filename index.html is just a convention that has become popular over time and lets any other programmer (or even you, if you forget) know which file is the main file of your website.
                </p>
                <h2>Write your first HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that you have your empty index.html file open in your text editor, you can write your first HTML. Type or copy the following into your empty index.html file:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        &lt;html&gt;
                            &lt;body&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>There are a few basic pieces to look at here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        &lt;html&gt;: The <strong>html element</strong> is the base container for everything else on your webpage. Every other element you add will go inside of this one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;body&gt;: The <strong>body element</strong> is where you will put all of the actual content of your website. If you were to leave it blank, you could still load the page, but you'd see nothing but a white screen. To start, all we'll put inside is a paragraph element, which you saw in the last lesson.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;p&gt;: The <strong>paragraph element</strong> is just like the paragraph elements you've seen before. This one is just nested inside other elements.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Only the &lt;p&gt; element will actually show up as something you can see on the page. The others are what is often referred to as <strong>boilerplate code</strong>, meaning that they appear unchanged in just about every HTML document because your browser requires them.
                </p>
                <h2>Nesting</h2>
                <p>
                    You might have noticed a few things about how that code was <strong>formatted</strong>, too. For example, some of the elements are inside other elements. This is another example of the concept of <strong>nested elements</strong> that we covered before. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that you can think of most HTML elements as <strong>containers</strong>. For example, in the code above:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; tags contain the &lt;body&gt;element</li>
                    <li>The &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags contain the &lt;p&gt;element</li>
                    <li>The &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;tags contain some text</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/nest.png" alt="">
                <h2>Indentations</h2>
                <p>
                    There are also indentations before some of the tags. They're there to make the code <strong>more readable</strong> to the programmer working on it. Some people prefer to use the <strong>tab key</strong> to make these indentations, while others prefer a few presses of the <strong>space bar</strong>, but in either case, the goal is to have an increasing amount of space for each layer of <strong>nested elements</strong>, which makes it clearer which elements are inside of which. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as your browser goes, the amount you indent each element <strong>makes no difference</strong>. Your browser could read that code formatted this way just as easily:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
                </code>
                <p>
                    That kind of formatting would make things <strong>much more difficult</strong> for you, though, and would make it much easier to make a mistake if you wanted to change something.
                </p>
                <h2>View your webpage</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you've filled in your HTML file and saved it, you can view it as a webpage in your browser. Just follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open your <strong>File Explorer</strong> or <strong>Finder</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to your <strong>GCF Programming Tutorials</strong> project and click inside.</li>
                    <li>Double-click your <strong>index.html</strong> file.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The file should open in your default web browser. You should see something like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images/helloworld.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Congratulations! You just created your first webpage!
