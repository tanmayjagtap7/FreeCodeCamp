                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine that you're building a house. One of the first things you would do to build a house is put up a frame. There would be nothing but plain, wooden beams in the rough shape of a house, and you wouldn't be able to live in it yet, but it would give an approximation of what the house would eventually look like. The frame would provide the foundation you need to keep working.
                </p>
                <img src="images\house-frame.png" alt="house-frame">
                <p>
                    You can think of <strong>HTML</strong> as that frame for a webpage. HTML is a computer language known as a <strong>markup language</strong>, and the vast majority of the webpages you see on the Internet every day are made of HTML, among other things. 
                </p>

                <h2>What are HTML elements?</h2>
                <p>
                    Like the frame of a house might be composed of individual pieces of wood, an <strong>HTML document</strong> is composed of individual <strong>HTML elements</strong>. Here is an example of a simple HTML element:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;This is an element&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    Each HTML element is made up of <strong>tags</strong>, which for this element are the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; symbols you see on either side. You can think of them as a <strong>container</strong>, where the &lt;p&gt; tag marks the beginning of an element, the &lt;/p&gt; tag marks the end, and the content is the text in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tags in the image below specify that the text inside is a <strong>paragraph</strong>, which lets your browser know how to display it. If you were to load that &lt;p&gt; element in a webpage, for example, you would not see the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags on the screen. Your browser would just read those tags as <strong>instructions</strong> to take the text in between and show it on the screen, and to give that text a little space above and below, and to let it take up a whole line on its own, just like a paragraph printed in a book.
                </p>
                <img src="images\hml2.png" alt="hml2">
                <p>
                    In other words, HTML elements provide the <strong>structure</strong> of your page, just like the frame provides the structure of a house. HTML elements generally look very plain on their own—we'll get to that later, when <strong>CSS</strong> provides the <strong>presentation</strong> of your page—but they are the skeleton under all of the webpages you visit.
                </p>
                <h2>Nested Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    If you think of an HTML element as a <strong>container</strong>, it's important to note that text is not the only thing that can go inside of it. Sometimes you will want to put one HTML element inside of another, which is referred to as <strong>nesting</strong> the element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you wanted to make one of the words in a paragraph italic, the HTML element &lt;i&gt; can do that, but to pick out just one word in your paragraph, you would need to <strong>put it inside the paragraph element</strong>. It might look like this, for example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;p&gt;Here is a paragraph with &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; word in italics.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    In this case, the <strong>paragraph element</strong> contains both text and an <strong>italic element</strong>>. It would display in your browser like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images\italics.PNG" alt="italics">
                <h2>How does that make a webpage?</h2>
                <p>
                    A webpage is a <strong>collection of HTML elements</strong> in an HTML document. The HTML for a very simple webpage might look something like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;h1&gt;My Coding Blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;February 13, 2020&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard all the best web companies start out in garages. My garage is full of trash, though, so what am I supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Most of the webpages you regularly visit are going to have more elements than this, and there are some that your browser will require by default. <strong>Don't worry about that for now</strong>, though. The important thing to keep in mind is that an HTML document is a file, just like any other file you might find on you computer. For example, you could save the the code above to your hard drive and call it <strong>website.html</strong>:
                </p>
                <img src="images\htmlfile.jpg" alt="htmlfile">
                <p>
                    Then you could double-click it to open it with a <strong>web browser</strong>, just the way one might open a Word Document in Microsoft Word. When your browser opens the file, it uses the HTML you've written as <strong>instructions</strong> to determine what it should show on the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The webpages you visit every day on the Internet are no different. When you <strong>enter a web address</strong> into your search bar or <strong>on a link</strong>, you're sending a request to a computer somewhere else, and that computer sends you a response in the form of an HTML document. In turn, your browser reads that HTML document, just like it would if you double-clicked an HTML file on your hard drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, try <a href="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/global/coding/simplehtml.html">clicking here</a> to open the example as an <strong>actual webpage</strong>. You should see something like this in a new tab or window:
                </p>
                <img src="images\blogsample.PNG" alt="blogsample">
                <p>Now follow these quick steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Right-click</strong> anywhere on the page you just opened.</li>
                    <li>
                        Find and click the option that says <strong>View page source</strong>. Depending on what browser you're using, it's possible that the option may not be there. We recommend using <strong>Google</strong> Chrome to ensure that you have the best experience with these exercises.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images\viewpagesource.jpg" alt="viewpagesource">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another tab or window should open, showing you the <strong>HTML</strong> of the page.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images\rawhtml.jpg" alt="rawhtml">
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Look familiar?</p>
                <p>
                    Most of the webpages you visit certainly look more complicated than what you see here, but the <strong>underlying frame</strong> is still the same. No matter how elaborate they may be, the core is still HTML.

                    Once you have a basic grasp on what HTML actually is, you need to be able to see it work. A great way to do that is to <strong>write and run your own HTML</strong> on your computer. This lesson assumes that you've set up your workspace and are comfortable with the general skills that all of these tutorials require, so be sure to read lessons if not.
                </p>
                <h2>Create the file</h2>
                <p>Follow these steps to create your first HTML file.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open <strong>Sublime Text</strong>.</li>
                    <li>
                        Open the <strong>File</strong> menu and select <strong>New File</strong>.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/newfile.jpg" alt="newfile">
                    </li>
                    <li>You should see a <strong>new tab</strong> open in Sublime Text labeled <strong>untitled</strong>.</li>
                    <li>
                        Go back to the <strong>File</strong> menu and choose <strong>Save As</strong>.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/saveas.jpg" alt="saveas">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find the <strong>GCF Programming Tutorials</strong> folder you created when you set up your workspace and <strong>double-click</strong> on it.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/saveas2.jpg" alt="saveas2">
                    </li>
                    <li>Name your file <strong>index.html</strong> and press the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You have now created an <strong>empty HTML file</strong> where you'll write your first code in the following steps. There isn't anything fundamentally different about the file you just created and a text file, for example, which you could have named index.txt. The difference is that the <strong>file extension</strong> (.html, as opposed to .txt) will let any program trying to open the file know what kinds of contents it will find inside.
                </p>
                <img src="images/filename.png" alt="filename">
                <p>
                    The name you gave it, <strong>index.html</strong>, is a common name for the <strong>home page</strong> of a website. You could name it mywebsite.html, or xxlovin2codexx.html, or whatever you want, and it will work the same. The filename index.html is just a convention that has become popular over time and lets any other programmer (or even you, if you forget) know which file is the main file of your website.
                </p>
                <h2>Write your first HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that you have your empty index.html file open in your text editor, you can write your first HTML. Type or copy the following into your empty index.html file:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>There are a few basic pieces to look at here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        &lt;html&gt;: The <strong>html element</strong> is the base container for everything else on your webpage. Every other element you add will go inside of this one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;body&gt;: The <strong>body element</strong> is where you will put all of the actual content of your website. If you were to leave it blank, you could still load the page, but you'd see nothing but a white screen. To start, all we'll put inside is a paragraph element, which you saw in the last lesson.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;p&gt;: The <strong>paragraph element</strong> is just like the paragraph elements you've seen before. This one is just nested inside other elements.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Only the &lt;p&gt; element will actually show up as something you can see on the page. The others are what is often referred to as <strong>boilerplate code</strong>, meaning that they appear unchanged in just about every HTML document because your browser requires them.
                </p>
                <h2>Nesting</h2>
                <p>
                    You might have noticed a few things about how that code was <strong>formatted</strong>, too. For example, some of the elements are inside other elements. This is another example of the concept of <strong>nested elements</strong> that we covered before. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that you can think of most HTML elements as <strong>containers</strong>. For example, in the code above:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; tags contain the &lt;body&gt;element</li>
                    <li>The &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags contain the &lt;p&gt;element</li>
                    <li>The &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;tags contain some text</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/nest.png" alt="nest">
                <h2>Indentations</h2>
                <p>
                    There are also indentations before some of the tags. They're there to make the code <strong>more readable</strong> to the programmer working on it. Some people prefer to use the <strong>tab key</strong> to make these indentations, while others prefer a few presses of the <strong>space bar</strong>, but in either case, the goal is to have an increasing amount of space for each layer of <strong>nested elements</strong>, which makes it clearer which elements are inside of which. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as your browser goes, the amount you indent each element <strong>makes no difference</strong>. Your browser could read that code formatted this way just as easily:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Hello, world!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    That kind of formatting would make things <strong>much more difficult</strong> for you, though, and would make it much easier to make a mistake if you wanted to change something.
                </p>
                <h2>View your webpage</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you've filled in your HTML file and saved it, you can view it as a webpage in your browser. Just follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open your <strong>File Explorer</strong> or <strong>Finder</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to your <strong>GCF Programming Tutorials</strong> project and click inside.</li>
                    <li>Double-click your <strong>index.html</strong> file.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The file should open in your default web browser. You should see something like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images/helloworld.jpg" alt="helloworld">
                <p>
                    Congratulations! You just created your first webpage!

                <h2>Adding text elements in HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the most common HTML elements that make up a webpage are <strong>text elements</strong>. All the text you read on this website, for example, whether it's the titles at the top of the page, the section headers, or this very text, is made from HTML text elements.
                </p>
                <img src="images/textElement.png" alt="textElement">
                <h2>The paragraph element</h2>
                <p>
                    The most basic way of adding text to a web page is the <strong>paragraph element</strong>. If you've been following along with this tutorial, you've seen this element before, but it's worth repeating, because the paragraph element is one of the most common HTML elements used on most of the websites you visit every day.
                </p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    By default, every browser puts a <strong>bit of space</strong> above and below paragraph elements when they display them, which keeps each paragraph independent from the ones around it, just like the paragraphs you'd see printed in a book or magazine.
                </p>
                <h2>The heading elements</h2>
                <p>
                    Like the paragraph element, <strong>heading elements</strong> are also used to display text on the screen. They're generally used to create <strong>section headings</strong>. 
                </p>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading element&lt;h1&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    For example, you might use a heading element to display the title of an essay you're writing, or the name of a chapter in a book. The actual text of the essay or chapter, on the other hand, would use paragraph elements.
                </p>
                <img src="images/HeadingAndParagraph.png" alt="HeadingAndParagraph">
                <p>
                    Heading elements come in <strong>six default levels</strong>, &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;, which you can think of as an <strong>order of importance</strong>. If you put an &lt;h1&gt; on your web page, for example, it's safe to assume that it's the most important section heading and probably at the top of your page, while an &lt;h2&gt; is slightly less and important, and so on.

                <h2>Adding lists in HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    Another HTML element meant to help you structure the content on your page is the <strong>list element</strong>. You probably see lists on webpages all the time—rows of content marked by bullet points, or numbers, or Roman numerals—and sometimes you may be looking at lists without even realizing that the underlying structure is an HTML list. In all of these cases, one of two HTML elements is behind it: the <strong>unordered list</strong> or the <strong>ordered list</strong>.
                </p>
                <img src="
                images/lists.png" alt="lists">
                <h2>Unordered lists</h2>
                <p>An <strong>unordered list</strong> element looks like this:</p>
                <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    However, unlike what you've seen so far, these tags don't do anything on their own. To display content as a list, you need <strong>two HTML elements working together</strong>: the list itself, like the &lt;ul&gt; element above, and the <strong>list item</strong> element, which goes inside:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is a list item.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is a second list item.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Three list items right here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    In an unordered list like this one, your browser would not actually display anything for the &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; tags themselves. Instead, it would treat them as <strong>instructions</strong> for how to display the &lt;li&gt; elements inside. An unordered list tells the browser to display each list item with a <strong>bullet point</strong> by default. If you were to load that example in your browser, it would look like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images/ul-list.PNG" alt="ul-list">
                <h2>Ordered lists</h2>
                <p>
                    An ordered list element looks like this:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    The structure of an ordered list element is <strong>basically the same</strong> as that of an unordered list: the &lt;ol&gt; element is the root, and any number of &lt;li&gt; elements go inside of it:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is a list item.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is a second list item.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Three list items right here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    However, in an ordered list, your browser counts the list items inside and <strong>automatically adds numbers</strong> next to them, rather than bullet points.  If you were to load this example in your browser, it would look like this:
                </p>

            <header>Links and Images in HTML</header>
            <article>
                <h2>Adding links and images in HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    After text elements, the HTML elements you'll see most often are <strong>links</strong> and <strong>images</strong>. Almost every time you navigate to a new page on a website or a new website altogether, you click on a link to do it, and nearly every website you visit is likely covered with images, this one included. They may seem unrelated at first, but both are set apart from the text elements you've seen so far because they rely on <strong>HTML attributes</strong> to be useful.
                </p>
                <h2>HTML attributes </h2>
                <p>
                    An HTML attribute is an extra bit of information you can include along with an element that tells the browser more about it. In most cases, it consists of a <strong>name</strong> and <strong>value</strong> included in the opening tag of the element and formatted like this:
                </p>
                <code>name="value"</code>
                <p>
                    For example, this is an element with an HTML attribute where the name is "id" and the value is "myParagraph":
                </p>
                <img src="images/html_attribute.png" alt="html_attribute">
                <p>
                    Any HTML element can have attributes, and there are a variety of different HTML attributes with different functions, but we'll get into them later. The big thing that sets links and images apart is that they <strong>must have HTML attributes</strong> to do anything at all.
                </p>
                <h2>Links </h2>
                <p>
                    The HTML element for a link is actually called an <strong>anchor element</strong>. An anchor element with no HTML attribute might look like this:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;a&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;
                </code>
                <p>
                    If you wanted, you could add that to your <strong>index.html page</strong>, and you'd see the text when you loaded it in the browser. However, without an HTML attribute, your anchor element wouldn't do anything. It would be <strong>nothing but text</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's say you wanted your anchor element to <strong>link back to this website</strong>, so if anybody were to click on it, their browser would be redirected to our homepage. That anchor element would look more like this:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;a&gt; href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/"&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;
                </code>
                <p>
                    The part you'd actually see on the page would be unchanged: just the words "Click me." If somebody were to click on it, though, they would be taken to our homepage. You could put the URL for any website as the value of an href attribute—whatever <strong>web address</strong> you see in the address bar of your browser—to make a link that navigates to it.

            <header>Interactive Elements in HTML</header>
            <article>
                <h2>Adding interactive elements in HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you've added text, links, and images, you've got most of the basic pieces you're likely see in the websites you visit every day. However, the last essential components are <strong>interactive elements</strong>. Any time you put a username and password into a login field, or press a button to open a menu, or click a checkbox on a settings page, you're dealing with interactive elements such as <strong>buttons</strong> and <strong>inputs</strong>.
                </p>
                <h2>Buttons</h2>
                <p>
                    The HTML element for a <strong>button</strong> is exactly what you might guess:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;button&gt;Press me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    It might feel more complicated than that because you see so many different types of buttons, and they often look radically different from one another. However, the vast majority of those looks are accomplished with <strong>CSS</strong>, which we will cover later; the underlying HTML is usually no more complicated than what you see above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The text inside the button element is what will be displayed on the button, but it can also contain <strong>image elements</strong> instead. For example, a common type of button you see on many websites (this one included) is called a <strong>hamburger button</strong>, named because the image it uses resembles a hamburger. The HTML might look like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;button&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/global/coding/hamburger-button.png"&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Other than links, most of the things you click on a webpage to make something happen are probably button elements, even if they look extremely different from one another.
                </p>
                <h2>Inputs</h2>
                <p>
                    The other most common way you've probably interacted with websites is through <strong>inputs</strong>. At some point, you've probably been asked to enter a username and password for a website. Maybe there was a <strong>checkbox</strong> that asked if you had read a Terms of Service page, or something along those lines, and maybe a <strong>drop-down menu</strong> that asks you to choose an option from many. If you've ever created an account on this website, for example, you've seen and used all three:
                </p>
                <img src="images/gcf-create-account.jpg" alt="gcf-create-account">
                <p>
                    Each of these options is a type of <strong>HTML input</strong>. For example, these are the elements for a <strong>text input</strong> (like the ones you type a username or password into) and a <strong>checkbox input</strong>:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;input type="text"&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Notice that they actually use the same HTML element, &lt;input&gt;, with different <strong>HTML attribute values</strong>. Those values give the browser enough information to display two completely different things when loaded:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A drop-down input, on the other hand, is made using a <strong>select element</strong>, which contains a number of <strong>option elements</strong>. The HTML would look like something like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;select&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;The First Option&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Another One&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Bunch of Options Here&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    This element is structured similarly to the &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements you used to make lists. That's because the &lt;select&gt; element itself isn't displayed; instead, it acts as instructions to tell the browser how to display the &lt;option&gt; elements nested inside.

            <article>
                <h2>Block-level, Inline, and Organizational Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    When you load a webpage in your browser, all the HTML elements on the page have default ways of <strong>visually organizing themselves</strong>. For example, &lt;p&gt; elements all stack up nicely on their own lines, while &lt;a&gt; elements line up on a single line. Almost every other HTML element follows one of those patterns as well, because they all generally fall into one of two categories: <strong>block-level</strong> or <strong>inline</strong> elements.
                </p>
                <img src="images/block_vs_inline_diagram.png" alt="block_vs_inline_diagram">
                <h2>Block-level elements</h2>
                <p>
                    A block-level element is an HTML element that takes up the <strong>full width of the element that contains it</strong>. You've already seen a few of them, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;p&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;ul&gt;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Take a &lt;p&gt; element, for example. Even if you only put one word in a &lt;p&gt; element, it <strong>takes up all the width that's available to it</strong>. Below is a &lt;p&gt; element that has been colored; notice that it reaches from one end of the image to the other, even though only part of it actually has any text in it.
                </p>
                <img src="images/psingle.jpg" alt="psingle">
                <p>
                    Because block-level elements take up all of the width available to them, they stack on top of each other, rather than lining up:
                </p>
                <img src="images/pstacked.jpg" alt="pstacked">
                <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    An inline element is an HTML element that <strong>only takes up the width that its content takes up</strong>. You've seen a few of these, too:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;a&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;b&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;i&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;img&gt;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To illustrate, let's take that stack of &lt;p&gt; elements from the last section and make them all &lt;a&gt; elements instead. &lt;a&gt; elements are inline elements, rather than block-level, which means that instead of taking up all the width they have available, they will only <strong>take up enough for their content</strong>. In this case, that's text. Here they are colored for visibility:
                </p>
                <img src="images/aelements.jpg" alt="aelements">
                <p>
                    Notice that these elements don't stretch beyond the text they contain. In turn, they have the room to line up on a single line, and they won't move to a new line until they run out of space. This behavior makes it so that inline elements are well-suited to being used inside of block-level elements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't worry about memorizing which elements are block and which are inline, or feeling like it's too much information to take in. The important thing is just to <strong>remember the concept</strong> of block-level and inline elements, as well as <strong>the general distinction</strong> between the two. Every programmer will forget what element is what from time to time, but if you remember the concept, you will have a good idea of where to start when something on your webpage doesn't display the way you expected. 
                </p>
                <h2>Organizational elements</h2>
                <p>
                    The purest form of block-level and inline elements are two HTML elements used primarily for organizing other elements: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;
                </p>
                <h2>Div</h2>
                <p>
                    The &lt;div&gt; element is a block-level element used almost exclusively to <strong>group other elements</strong>. For example, you might group a few paragraphs with a &lt;div&gt; element, and it would look like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a paragraph element, which is block-level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph element. Same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check it out, they're all stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The &lt;div&gt; element <strong>doesn't look like anything</strong> on its own, though. If you were to load the HTML above in your browser, it wouldn't be apparent that there was a &lt;div&gt; element there; the three stacked paragraphs would look just like they did before. It's only there to hold other elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the &lt;div&gt; element will become much more apparent once you start learning <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. By grouping elements together, the &lt;div&gt; element makes it easier to target just certain parts of your webpage when you want to change the way they look or do something to them.
                </p>
                <h2>Span</h2>
                <p>
                    The &lt;span&gt; element functions much like the &lt;div&gt; element, but for inline elements, rather than block-level. For example, imagine that you wanted to group some of the words in one of your &lt;p&gt; elements, but not all of them. Because a &lt;div&gt; element is block-level, it would not be suited to that task, but a &lt;span&gt; would:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;p&gt;Here's a paragraph, but &lt;span&gt;these words&lt;/span&gt; are grouped.&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
                <p>
                    Like the &lt;div&gt; element, this <strong>wouldn't look any different</strong> from a regular &lt;p&gt; element on its own; if you loaded it in the browser, you wouldn't see any hint that a &lt;span&gt; element was there. However, it would make it easier to target just those words with CSS or JavaScript.

            <article>
                <h2>Metadata and the Head Element</h2>
                <p>
                    The HTML we've been working with so far works, but it's technically missing some pieces that every browser expects it to include: the <strong>DOCTYPE declaration</strong> and the <strong>head element</strong>. Unlike most of the elements you've worked with so far, though, these ones are not focused on creating the structure of what you see on the page. Instead, they're focused on establishing the <strong>metadata</strong> of your webpage. 
                </p>
                <img src="images/metadata.png" alt="metadata">
                <h2>Metadata</h2>
                <p>
                    Metadata is often described as <strong>"data about data."</strong> In other words, if the HTML of your webpage is data, metadata is additional information used to explain various things about that HTML. For example, one might use it to establish:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What version of HTML a webpage is using</li>
                    <li>The title of a webpage</li>
                    <li>An image or text that sums up a webpage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In turn, anything that reads your webpage—a browser, or a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter where it might be shared, or a search engine like Google that might automatically collect information about all sorts of webpages—can use that metadata to tell people useful information about your webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>The DOCTYPE declaration</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most essential pieces of metadata that is required on every webpage is the <strong>DOCTYPE declaration</strong>. It should be the first thing you see in an HTML document (we'll be adding it to yours shortly) and looks like this:
                </p>
                <code><&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    This particular DOCTYPE declaration states both that an HTML document <strong>contains HTML</strong>, and that the version of that HTML is <strong>HTML5</strong>. It's important because there are still plenty of webpages on the Internet written in older versions of HTML. For example, some webpages might have a DOCTYPE declaration that looks more like this:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    That declaration specifies an earlier version of HTML (4.1), which has some differences from HTML5. When you load a webpage that doesn't have a DOCTYPE declaration, your browser goes into a special mode called <strong>quirks mode</strong>. That basically just means that the browser is guessing what kind of HTML a webpage is using, and when the browser starts guessing, it sometimes gets things wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>The head element</h2>
                <p>
                    The rest of the metadata one might provide for a webpage goes inside of a special HTML element called <strong>the &lt;head&gt; element</strong>. It looks like this:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    Like many of the other HTML elements you've used, you can think of it as a container meant to hold all the various types of metadata you might want to include. However, it's <strong>not part of the structure of your webpage</strong>; it's not visible when you load the webpage, and none of the elements you put inside of it will be either. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simplest version of a head element contains just one thing: <strong>the &lt;title&gt; element</strong>. The &lt;title&gt; element, as the name suggests, should contain the title of your webpage. It's the only thing your browser requires the head element to contain:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;title&gt;My Very Good Webpage&lt;/title&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    The &lt;title&gt; element lets anything that reads your HTML document know what to call it. For example, most browsers use the &lt;title&gt; element to determine what to show in the tab for that webpage. If you were to load a webpage with the above title element in your browser, you'd see this in your browser tab:
                </p>
                <img src="images/browser-tab.jpg" alt="browser-tab">
                <h2>Real-world metadata</h2>
                <p>
                    It may feel at first like metadata is unimportant—you can't see it doing anything on your webpage, after all—but <strong>you're actually seeing metadata in use all the time</strong> in day-to-day life. For example, let's consider this site. If you were to search for GCFLearnFree on Google, this would be your top result:
                </p>
                <img src="images/gcflearnfree-google.jpg" alt="gcflearnfree-google">
                <p>
                    However, if you go to our homepage, you'll notice that the description given on the Google result is nowhere to be found on the page. That's because Google has automatically <strong>pulled it from the metadata</strong> included in our HTML:
                </p>
                <code>&lt;meta name="description" content="GCFGLobal - The freedom to learn what you want, when you want, absolutely free! Check out our Everyday Life, Basic Math, and Computer Training today!"&gt;</code>
                <p>
                    If you were to share our homepage on Facebook, you'd see something like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images/fbshare.jpg" alt="fbshare">
                <p>
                    Just like before, the images and text you see there <strong>don't appear on the homepage</strong>. Instead, they also come from a handful of slightly different meta tags in the head element, these particular ones required by Facebook:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>&lt;meta property="og:title" content="Free Online Learning at GCFGlobal"&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="GCFGLobal - The freedom to learn what you want, when you want, absolutely free! Check out our Everyday Life, Basic Math, and Computer Training today!"&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image" content="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/global/layout/social/gcf-website-image.png"&gt;</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    In other words, metadata doesn't necessarily tell you or show you much when you're just looking at your own webpage, but it does a lot to help your browser make sense of your HTML, and it can provide tools for things like social media platforms and search engines to <strong>understand and explain what your webpage is all about</strong>.
